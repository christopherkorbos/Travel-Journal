This is a project for the React online course and it intends to deeply understand the basics of the React-Data relationships via the props.The project was also made for better understanding of how the .map() array method works and a reminder to Javascript Algorithms and how plain JS combines with JSX components. There has also been an attempt for a more or less responsive design across different platforms via media queries. Lastly all data used originate from a plain .js file.
